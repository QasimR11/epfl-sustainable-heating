# Modernizing EPFL Heating System: A Sustainable Energy Strategy

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of energy optimization strategies for the EPFL campus, encompassing energy demand analysis, heat recovery, heat pump (HP) modeling, and energy system integration.

The study identifies energy demands across campus buildings, emphasizing critical factors such as thermal conductivity (k~th~) and solar gain coefficients (k~sun~). A detailed analysis suggests that targeted renovations, combined with optimized parameters, can reduce overall heating demand by a significant margin.

Heat recovery systems are analyzed for their ability to reclaim waste heat from campus processes. Preliminary calculations indicate close to 30% reduction in heat load of the campus in selected scenarios, offering substantial opportunities to reduce waste and improve system efficiency.

A two-stage heat pump system, designed to provide up to 6 MW of thermal capacity, is modeled to address heating demands. The proposed system demonstrates a coefficient of performance (COP) exceeding 4 under optimal conditions, underscoring its suitability for large-scale applications like the EPFL campus. This advanced system incorporates a competitive working fluid (R-290), further enhancing its efficiency.

Finally, an integrated energy system is proposed, combining renewable energy sources and advanced control algorithms to optimize campus-wide energy use through Multi-Integer Linear Programming. Projections highlight the potential for significant reductions in energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, aligning with EPFL’s sustainability goals.

This integrated approach demonstrates the feasibility of achieving sustainable energy solutions while maintaining high performance and cost efficiency. The findings underscore the critical role of advanced modeling and integration in modern energy systems.
