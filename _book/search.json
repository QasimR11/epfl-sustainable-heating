In this case the heating system of the EPFL campus has to be renewed, due to it reaching its operational lifetime. The analysis begins with an assessment of the campus’s energy demands to establish the requirements for the new heating system. Next, a nonlinear programming optimization is applied to determine the optimal heat exchanger area for various heat recovery options. A two-stage heat pump is then modeled using the working fluids R-290 and R-1234yf, evaluating their economic, environmental, and thermodynamic performance to identify the most suitable choice. Finally, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) optimization explores the integration of different energy technologies, aiming to identify the optimal configuration for future implementation.\n\n\n3 Introduction\nThe energy system of EPFL currently comprises three interconnected components: heating, cooling, and electricity, each powered by an aggregate of systems. However, the existing heating system, installed in the early 1970s, is nearing the end of its operational lifetime and can no longer support the growing energy demands of the campus. The rapid expansion of infrastructure at EPFL has significantly increased the campus’s energy requirements, necessitating an efficient, modern replacement for the outdated heating system (Coccolo, Kaempf, and Scartezzini 2015).\nIn response, the infrastructure management team at EPFL is actively exploring replacement options. Each potential solution is evaluated based on three critical performance metrics: economic viability, energetic efficiency, and environmental impact. The aim is to identify a solution that combines maximum energy efficiency with minimal infrastructure and operational costs, while also achieving a significant reduction in carbon emissions. This task is not only vital for meeting the campus’s current needs but also for ensuring its alignment with future sustainability goals.\nThis report addresses the task of optimizing EPFL’s heating system, structured as part of a five-stage project. The initial step involves analyzing the heating energy demands of the campus to establish a comprehensive understanding of current and projected requirements. The focus then shifts to exploring opportunities for heat recovery, particularly from the ventilation air, as a means to enhance system efficiency and reduce waste. Subsequently, a two-stage heat pump model is developed to assess its performance and to evaluate the suitability of various working fluids in terms of cost, efficiency, and environmental performance. These efforts are complemented by the integration of additional technological utilities, such as photovoltaic panels or electric boilers into the campus’s energy infrastructure. The project concludes with an evaluation of these solutions under different scenarios, enabling a comprehensive comparison of their benefits and trade-offs.\nThe proposed approach aims to provide EPFL with a sustainable, efficient, and cost-effective heating system that addresses both current challenges and future opportunities. By combining technical analysis with scenario-based evaluations, this report seeks to offer actionable insights and recommendations for the administration, ultimately contributing to EPFL’s vision of energy innovation and sustainability.\n\n\n\n\nCoccolo, Silvia, Jérôme Kaempf, and Jean-Louis Scartezzini. 2015. “The EPFL Campus in Lausanne: New Energy Strategies for 2050.” Energy Procedia 78: 3174–79.",

    "text": "2.1 Introduction\nThe main objective of this part of the project is to analyze the energy demands of the EPFL campus. This requires consideration of several aspects of each building on-site, which can be categorized into two groups: heating gains and losses, and design characteristics. A thorough analysis of the latter is essential for accurately determining the energy required throughout the year to maintain an appropriate level of thermal comfort. The first group evaluates the hourly thermal gains from occupants, based on building occupancy profiles, as well as from electronic appliances and solar radiation. The second group estimates the thermal properties of the buildings by examining the annual heating demand.\nOnce these parameters are defined, the hourly heating demand for each building can be calculated for the entire year using the following equation:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n& \\mathrm{\\dot{Q}_{th}(t) = A_{th} \\cdot (k_th \\cdot (T_{int}~ − T{ext}(t)) − k_{sun}\\cdot \\dot{i}(t) − \\dot{q}_{people}(t)) − f_{el} \\cdot \\dot{Q}_{el}(t)} \\\\\n& \\quad \\mathrm{If \\ \\dot{Q}_{th}(t) \\leq 0 \\ , \\ cooling} \\\\\n& \\quad \\mathrm{If \\ \\dot{Q}_{th}(t) \\geq 0 \\ , \\ heating}\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{2.1}\\]\nwhere,\nAt the end of this first part, a clustering method is applied to outline the yearly demand over a typical period carefully defined. This method allows to reduce the number of data points, thus reducing the computational costs and time.\nTable 2.1 shows the data for EPFL buildings. In this table, the buildings are divided into two groups based on construction years: Group 1 and Group 2. This classification corresponds to two construction periods, where Group 1 represents buildings with medium temperature demand (65 °C), also referred to as the medium temperature loop, and Group 2 represents buildings with low temperature demand (50 °C).\nTable 2.1: Data for EPFL buildings",

    "text": "2.2 Calculation of the internal heat gains\nFirst, the thermal gains from people, appliances and solar radiation need to be determined in order to understand better the heat demand on the campus. A few assumptions are made along the process in order to simplify the EPFL consumption model. The thermal gains from the people are estimated considering an averaged daily occupancy profile over the whole year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Daily occupancy profile for the calculation of heat load\n\n\n\n\n\nAs seen on Figure 2.1, the rates of occupancy per building are structured into three sectors: Office, Canteen and Classroom. As defined in the Table 2.2, each sector is characterized by an averaged heat gain (W/m2) value and an area ratio of the buildings.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.2: Parameters per sector of the buildings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.1 Internal gains - People\nHence, the hourly heat loads from the people per building can be computed as the sum of the hourly heat loads from each three sectors per building, according to eq 2.2:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{\\dot{q}_{people} = \\sum_{i} \\dot{q}_{i} \\times S_{i} \\times \\Omega_{i}}\n\\tag{2.2}\\]\nwhere,\n\n\\(\\mathrm{\\dot{q}_{i}}\\) : heat gain per sector i \\(\\mathrm{W}\\)\n\\(\\mathrm{S_{i}}\\) : the share \\(\\mathrm{A_{i}/A_{th}}\\) with \\(\\mathrm{A_{th}}\\) being the total heated area per building \\(\\mathrm{[m^2]}\\)\n\\(\\mathrm{\\Omega_{i}}\\) : the occupancy rate per hour \\(\\mathrm{[\\%]}\\)\n\nThe occupancy of the building is assumed to be the same each day throughout the year.

Knowing the daily demand of electricity per building over the year, it is also assumed that it follows a uniform distribution over the operating hours. Thus, the heat from appliances per building is given by eq 2.3\n\\[\n\\mathrm{\\dot{Q}_{appl} = f_{el} \\times \\dot{Q}_{el}}\n\\tag{2.3}\\]\nwhere fel is the share of electricity demand which is converted to heat appliances, for the study it is assumed to be equal to 0.8.

    "text": "2.3 Thermal properties of the building (kth and ksun)\nA main element of the heating demand lies in the thermal characteristics of the buildings described with the heat transfer coefficients kth and ksun. While the former quantifies the thermal losses from the building envelope and the ventilation system, the latter quantifies the thermal gains by solar radiation.\n\\[\nk_{\\mathrm{th}} = U_{\\mathrm{env}} + \\dot{m}_{\\mathrm{air}} \\cdot c_{p,air}\n\\tag{2.4}\\]\nwith \\(\\dot{m}_{\\mathrm{air}}\\) the exterior air renewal, \\(c_{p,air}\\) the air specific heat capacity and \\(U_{\\mathrm{env}}\\) the unknown overall heat transfer coefficient of the building envelope.\n\n2.3.1 Computation of kth and ksun\nConsidering that our problem has two unknowns, two equations are needed to assess these values.\nThe first equation lies in the yearly heating demand derived from the thermal load calculation. A cut-off temperature for heating is introduced as the heating system is assumed to be required only if the external temperature is below 16°C. \\(T_{cut}\\) is therefor equal to 16°C.\nThe hourly heat load can be finally expressed as: \\[\nQ_{\\mathrm{th}}(t) = \\Delta t ( A_{\\mathrm{th}} \\cdot (k_{\\mathrm{th}} \\cdot (T_{\\mathrm{int}} − T_{\\mathrm{ext}}(t)) − k_{\\mathrm{sun}} \\cdot \\dot{i}(t) − \\dot{q}_{\\mathrm{people}}(t) ) − f_{\\mathrm{el}} \\cdot \\dot{Q}_{\\mathrm{el}}(t) )\n\\tag{2.5}\\]\n\\(\\forall t\\), if \\(T_{\\mathrm{ext}}\\) \\(\\leq\\) \\(T_{\\text{cut-off}}\\).\nEnsuring positive heating power values, a non-linear quantity is defined: \\[\nQ^+_{\\mathrm{th}}(t) =\n\\begin{cases}\nQ_{\\mathrm{th}}(t), & \\text{if } Q_{\\mathrm{th}}(t) \\geq 0 \\\\\n0, & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{2.6}\\]\nThis allows the computation of the yearly heating demand merely as the sum over the 8760 hourly entries when the heat system is turned on: \\[\nQ^+_{\\mathrm{th,year}} = \\sum_{t=1}^{N_p} Q^+_{\\mathrm{th}}(t)\n\\tag{2.7}\\]\nThe second equation comes from the assumption that the heat load is zero when the external temperature is equal to the cut-off temperature ±1°C. Relying on the mean values for the irradiation, the electricity demand and the heat gain due to people on this defined range, this yields:\n\\[\n0 = A_{\\mathrm{th}} \\cdot (k_{\\mathrm{th}} \\cdot (T_{\\mathrm{int}} - T_{\\mathrm{cut}}) − k_{\\mathrm{sun}} \\cdot \\dot{i}_{\\text{mean}} − \\dot{q}_{\\mathrm{people,mean}}) − f_{\\mathrm{el}} \\cdot \\dot{Q}_{\\mathrm{el,mean}}\n\\]\nHence, \\[\nk_{\\mathrm{sun}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{th}} \\cdot (T_{\\mathrm{int}} - T_{\\mathrm{cut}}) - (\\dot{q}_{\\mathrm{people,mean}} + f_{\\mathrm{el}} \\cdot \\dot{Q}_{\\mathrm{el,mean}}) / A_{\\mathrm{th}}}{\\dot{i}_{\\mathrm{mean}}}\n\\tag{2.8}\\]\nThe resulting equation system is non-linear, which requires a method addressing non-linearities. The chosen method is the Newton-Raphson (NR) method. It aims to solve \\(f(x) = 0\\) using a Taylor development to approximate \\(f\\): \\[\nf(x_0 ) + (x^* − x_0 ) \\cdot f^′(x_0 ) ≅ f(x^*) = 0\n\\] which yields \\[\nx^* = x_0 − \\frac{f(x_0 )}{f^′(x_0)}\n\\]\nThe algorithm starts with an initial guess of \\(x^*\\) for \\(n = 0\\) and iterates as follows: \\[\nx_{n+1} = x_n − \\frac{f( x_n )}{f^′ ( x_n )}\n\\] until \\(f(x_{n+1})\\) is deemed sufficiently close to 0, i.e., lower than a convergence criterion \\(\\epsilon\\). The function \\(f\\) is formulated as:\n\\[\nf = Q^+_{\\mathrm{th,year}} − Q_{\\mathrm{th}} = 0\n\\tag{2.9}\\]\nwith \\(x = k_{\\mathrm{th}}\\) as the variable where \\(Q^+_{\\mathrm{th,year}}\\) is the calculated annual heat load, while \\(Q_{\\mathrm{th}}\\) is the annual heat load estimated.\nTo implement the NR method, the following sequence is used:\n\nA reference value of 5 W/m²/K is estimated for \\(k_{\\mathrm{th},0}\\).\n\\(k_{\\mathrm{sun},n}\\) is computed with the second equation, using \\(k_{\\mathrm{th},n}\\).\nThe function \\(f\\) is calculated with the two new terms.\n\\(f'\\) is evaluated, allowing computation of a new value for \\(k_{\\mathrm{th},n+1}\\).\n\nThis loop is iterated until the assumed tolerance of \\(|f(x)|\\) \\(\\leq\\) \\(\\epsilon\\) \\(= 10^{-6}\\) is reached.\nThe results from these computations are presented for each building in Table 2.3 .\n\n\n2.3.2 Results of the NR method computations\nThe values of \\(k_{th}\\) and \\(k_{sun}\\) calculated using the Newton-Raphson are presented in Table 2.3 for each building.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.3: Thermal characteristics of buildings (\\(k_{th}\\) and \\(k_{sun}\\)), determined by Newton-Raphson method\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hourly heat demand of one of the buildings (MA) for a year using the computations done in the earlier parts is shown in Figure 2.4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Hourly heat demand for MA building for the entire year",

    "text": "2.4 Impact of renovation and indoor temperature\nThrough the use of kth and ksun one can now look at the effect of the indoor temperature and renovation for the energy consumption of the different buildings.\n\n2.4.1 Renovation\nTo be able to see the effect of renovation, an overall heat transfer coefficient Uenvelope describing the buildings thermal performance has to be calculated. For our case, we wish to have low Uenvelope values, as it indicates that the building is well insulated and loses little heat to its surroundings, hence reducing the heating demand.\nTable 2.4 contains the data for overall heat transfer coefficient for each building. The overall heat transfer coefficient has been calculated using \\(U_{\\mathrm{envelope}} =  k_{\\mathrm{th}} - \\dot{m}_{\\mathrm{air}} \\cdot c_{p,air}\\) .\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.4: Building heat transfer coefficient\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo reduce the heating demand of a building, one wishes to decrease kth and increase ksun. A lower kth results in less heat loss to the sourroundings through the envelope. To decrease this value, adding insulation, upgrading windows and reducing thermal bridges may help. There are some constraints to how low one can get kth. If the building is to airtight, one needs to consider mechanical ventilation. Additionally, there is a need for sufficiently good air quality, which needs to be adressed. It is imporant to find the right balance between good indoor air quality and too high air renewal, since air renewal equals increased heat loss.\nWhen it comes to increasing ksun, this can be done by having more windows on the southern, eastern and western facade. Given that exisitng buildings are being analysed, another way to increase ksun is by upgrading the windows to newer windows with greater solar transmittance.\nIt is important to note that kth and ksun are not independent of eachother, as assumed for the following analysis. By changing to newer windows for instance, the kth might decrease at the same time due for instance to a possible reduction of thermal bridges.\nFigure 2.5 shows the impact of \\(\\mathrm{k_{sun}}\\) on the hourly heating demand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Hourly heat demand for different values of \\(k_{sun}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6 shows how the change in ventilation coefficient \\(\\mathrm{k_{th}}\\) influence the hourly heating demand of the building.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: Hourly heat demand for different values of \\(k_{th}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Indoor temperature\nIt is known that the indoor temperature has a significant effect on the working performance. Thus, it is important for the university as a place of work, but also as a place of studying, to have an indoor temperature optimizing performance. This temperature is said to be between 21 and 22 degrees Celsius Vimalanathan and Ramesh Babu (2014). For the heating demand, a lower indoor temperature can result in massive savings. The following graph depicts different heating demands for indoor temperatures ranging between 18 and 23 degrees Celsius.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: Hourly heat demand for constant \\(k_{th}\\) and \\(k_{sun}\\) with varying indoor temperatures",

    "section": "2.5 Typical periods",
    "text": "2.5 Typical periods\nFor modeling external conditions, hourly weather data for the entire year is available. However, using this high-resolution data directly poses significant computational challenges due to its size and complexity. A practical alternative is to define typical periods that accurately represent the year while significantly reducing computational demands.\nThere are multiple approaches to defining typical periods, each with its advantages: while monthly averages divide the year into 12 periods, with each period representing the average conditions of a month, seasonal averages group data based on seasons to reflect seasonal variations in external conditions. Alternatively, one could also use machine learning methods, such as clustering, to identify representative periods based on the similarity of conditions. In clustering-based approaches, typical periods represent averages or centroids of data groups, which may not capture extreme conditions. To account for this, extreme conditions are added as separate clusters for better representation.\nIn this work, two methods are used to define typical periods: monthly averages and k-means clustering.\n\n2.5.1 Monthly averages\nIn the monthly averages approach, the yearly data is first filtered to include only the hours when buildings are in operation. This ensures that periods with heating demands are prioritized. A simple average is then calculated for each month, providing a mean value for temperature and irradiation. These monthly averages serve as typical periods, as shown in Figure 2.8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: Typical periods defined using monthly averages (excluding the time when buildings are not in operation)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Clustering\nClustering is a machine learning technique used to classify data into subsets based on their similarity. It is categorized as unsupervised learning because the algorithm processes data without predefined class labels. Several clustering techniques are available in the literature, including hard k-means, soft k-means, and DBSCAN. For this work, the hard k-means algorithm (hereafter referred to as k-means) is employed.\nThe k-means algorithm partitions data into a specified number of disjoint, non-hierarchical clusters. It assigns each data point to a cluster such that the distance between the cluster center (centroid) and the data point is minimized. Typically, this distance is measured using the Euclidean norm, resulting in linearly separable clusters. For non-linear boundaries, higher-order norms or kernel-based methods can be employed. In k-means, clusters are non-overlapping, and each cluster contains at least one data point.\nThe primary advantage of k-means lies in its computational efficiency and guaranteed convergence under standard conditions. However, it has limitations, particularly its sensitivity to the initial guess of centroids. This sensitivity can lead to suboptimal clustering if not carefully addressed.\nBefore applying the clustering algorithm, the following pre-processing steps are performed to ensure meaningful results:\n\nData filtering - Only hours during which heating is required are retained. This includes weekdays from 7 A.M. to 9 P.M. when the external temperature is below 16°C. Filtering is crucial for this project, as the focus is on periods with heating demands.\nData normalization - Normalization ensures that all attributes, such as temperature and irradiation, have equal weight in the clustering process. This prevents differences in variable magnitudes from disproportionately influencing the results. Normalization is performed using the mapminmax approach (see Equation 2.10), with the normalized range set between 0 and 1. This step is essential because the k-means algorithm, relying on the Euclidean norm, is highly sensitive to variations in feature scales. \\[\ny = (y_{\\mathrm{max}}-y_{\\mathrm{min}}) \\frac{x-x_{\\mathrm{min}}}{x_{\\mathrm{max}}-x_{\\mathrm{min}}} + y_{\\mathrm{min}}\n\\tag{2.10}\\]\n\nBy filtering the data to relevant periods and normalizing it appropriately, the k-means algorithm effectively identifies clusters that represent distinct heating conditions for further analysis.\nThe Sci-kit learn library in Python is used for implementing the k-means algorithm. One critical hyperparameter in k-means is the number of clusters, which needs to be carefully selected. To determine the optimal number of clusters, two criteria were employed.\n\n2.5.2.1 Residual Sum of Squares (RSS)\nThe RSS measures the distance of each data point from its centroid across all clusters:\n\\[\nRSS = \\sum_{k=1}^K \\sum_{x\\in C_k} |x-\\mu^k|^2\n\\tag{2.11}\\]\nRSS quantifies how well the clusters represent the data points. However, a limitation of RSS is that it tends to decrease as the number of clusters increases. In fact, RSS reaches zero when the number of clusters equals the number of data points, making it less effective as a sole criterion for determining the optimal number of clusters.\n\n\n2.5.2.2 Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)\nThe BIC evaluates how well the model fits the data while penalizing the addition of parameters:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{BIC} = RSS + KN \\ln(M)\n\\]\nwhere: - \\(K\\): Number of clusters - \\(N\\): Data dimensionality - \\(M\\): Number of data points. The BIC introduces a penalty term, which ensures that the benefit of increasing the number of clusters must outweigh the additional complexity introduced. This helps avoid overfitting.\n\n\n2.5.2.3 Determining the Optimal Number of Clusters\nTo identify the optimal number of clusters, the k-means algorithm was run with varying cluster counts. Since clustering results can be sensitive to the initial guesses for cluster centroids, the random seed generator was fixed to ensure all runs started with the same initial guess.\nFigure 2.9 illustrates the effect of increasing the number of clusters on RSS and BIC. Based on this figure, the optimal number of clusters is determined to be 5 or 6, as increasing the number of clusters beyond this point results in diminishing improvements in RSS and an increase in BIC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.9: Effect of cluster number on performance\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final clustering results are shown in Figure 2.10. The figure depicts the typical periods identified using the k-means algorithm with \\(k = 3\\), including data only for periods when the buildings are in operation (weekdays from 07:00 to 21:00) and heating is required (temperature \\(&lt; 16^\\circ \\text{C}\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.10: Typical periods defined using k-means algorithm with k = 3. Includes only data for the period when buildings are in operation (weekdays 07.00-21.00) and when heating is required (Temperature &lt; 16°C)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.3 Choice of method for typical periods\nFigure 2.11 show the annual heating demand calculated using typical periods with original heating demand. Both method slightly underestimate the heating demand. Based on the annual heating demands alone, it is difficult to select the appropiate method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.11: Comparison of annual heating demand calcualated using typical periods with demand calculated using original weather data. Includes only data for the period when buildings are in operation (weekdays 07.00-21.00) and when heating is required (Temperature &lt; 16°C)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.12 compares the heat load curve for the original data with results from typical periods generated using two different methods; kmeans clustering and monthly averages.\n\nKmeans with k = 3 - The heat load curve (black line) intersects with all three typical periods near the middle. This indicates that the kmeans clustering aligns well closely with the original data, providing a more accurate representation of heating demand.\nMonthly Averages - The heat load curve (black line) often does not intersect with the typical periods, indicating a poor alignment. Monthly data fail to capture the variability accurately, leading to mismatched predictions of heat load.\n\nFrom the heat load curves, it’s evident that kmeans clustering provides a more reliable prediction of heating demand by aligning more closely with the original data, unlike the typical periods generated using monthly data, which show significant discrepancies.

The heat exchanged in the recovery heat exchanger is modeled as a function of the heat transfer coefficient, the heat transfer area, and the driving force, expressed as: \\[\n\\mathrm{Q_{HEDC}}[t] = \\mathrm{U_{HEDC} A_{HEDC} \\Delta T_{HEDC}}[t]\n\\tag{3.13}\\]\nwhere\n\n\\(U\\) is the heat transfer coefficient of recovery heat exchanger and is \\(\\mathrm{0.15 \\ kW \\cdot m^{-2} K^{-1}}\\).\n\\(A\\) is the heat transfer area \\(\\mathrm{m^{2}}\\).\n\\(\\Delta T_{\\text{LMTD}}\\) is the log mean temperature difference \\(\\mathrm{K}\\).\n\nThe above equation, eq 3.13, can be rearranged to get the exchanger area as given by eq 3.14 \\[\n\\mathrm{A_{HEDC}} \\geq \\frac{\\mathrm{Q_{HEDC}}[t]}{\\mathrm{U_{HEDC} \\Delta T_{HEDC}}[t]}\n\\tag{3.14}\\]\nThe inequality in eq 3.14 ensures that the exchanger area found in optimal solution is for the worst case scenario.

    "text": "3.5 Air Ventilation with Heat Pump Integration\nThe final heat recovery option involves utilizing heat from the air leaving the ventilation system as a heat source for a to-be-installed heat pump evaporator.

    "section": "3.6 Summary of optimization study",
    "text": "3.6 Summary of optimization study\nThe results of NLP optimization of energy system are illustrated in Figure 3.5, Figure 3.6. It is again worth mentioning that these results only consider the medium temperature buildings of the campus.\nCompared to the reference case, all three case studies resulted in lower total yearly costs (TOTEX), as shown in Table 3.12. The lowest TOTEX is achieved with heat recovery from ventilation air, followed by heat recovery from ventilation air with heat pump integration, and then heat recovery from data center. This is also reflected in terms of payback time, where the payback is lowest for the case of heat recovery from ventilation air and highest for the case of heat recovery from data center.\nIn terms of electricity consumption, ventilation with heat pump integration is the most efficient scenario, demonstrating the lowest annual electrical energy usage. The table also indicates that heat recovery from ventilation air can significantly reduce heating demands. Specifically, heat recovery with heat pump integration reduces heating demands from 19 691 MWh (no heat recovery) to 9 527 MWh (ventilation with heat pump).\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.12: Summary of NLP optimization problem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.13 shows the heat exchanger specifications and the recovered heat energy for each case. Maximum heat recovery is achieved with ventilation air and heat pump integration, though it requires a large heat exchanger surface area. The data center’s heat exchanger is smaller due to the lower available heat energy compared to ventilation air. However, the data center’s heat can be used to meet nearby buildings’ energy demands, making it a potential energy-saving alternative.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.13: Heat exchanger specifications for different scenarios\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe breakdown of total cost is visualized in Figure 3.5. It is interesting to note that despite having higher TOTEX, the operating costs are lowest for the case of heat recovery from air ventilation with heat pump case. The reason for higher TOTEX, is associated with the higher capital investment (CAPEX) required for installation of heat pump compared to the case where only a heat exchanger is installed to recover heat from ventilation air.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: Comparison of TOTEX of different heat recovery options with the current energy system (reference case)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6 illustrates the impact of various recovery options on energy savings, which in this context refers to the reduction in electrical energy requirements compared to the reference case. Air ventilation with heat pump integration yields the highest energy savings, while the data center offers the least. These energy savings directly influence OPEX, as depicted in Figure 3.5. From a \\(\\mathrm{CO}_2\\) emissions perspective, air ventilation with heat pump integration stands out as the most effective solution for minimizing the environmental impact of the heating system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: Comparison of electrical energy saved in each of the three scenarios\n\n\n\n\nBased on the obtained results, air ventilation with heat pump integration is the preferred technology. Although its TOTEX is slightly higher (4 201 CHF/year), compared to the case of heat recovery from ventilation air, the heat pump integration leads to higher energy savings and consequently lower \\(\\mathrm{CO}_2\\) emissions. Additionally, the long-term benefits of reduced carbon footprint and enhanced energy efficiency make this technology a more sustainable and environmentally friendly choice.",

    "text": "4.1 Introduction\nThe future centralized heating system at EPFL will utilize a two-stage heat pump with an estimated maximum capacity of 6 MWth. A two-stage heat pump is an advanced system designed to achieve higher efficiency and greater heating or cooling capacity compared to a single-stage heat pump (Morisaki et al. 2024). This design is particularly well-suited for applications requiring significant temperature lifts or large capacity adjustments, such as the EPFL campus.\nThe proposed heat pump model consists of two interconnected thermodynamic cycles, each comprising of the following key processes : an isothermal evaporation, an adiabatic compression, an isothermal condensation and an isentropic expansion.These two cycles are connected via a flash tank, which facilitates intermediate pressure regulation and enhances the system’s efficiency. The second loop ultimately delivers heat to meet the heating demands of the EPFL campus.\nThe performance will depend on its working fluid. As part of this project, an appropriate working fluid must be selected for the heat pump based on criterisa such as safety, economics, environmental impact, and other relevant properties. To facilitate this, a model of the heat pump is constructed using the process simulation software Belsim VALI.\nThis model consists of process units connected by stream flows. Each process unit transforms the stream flow thermo-chemically according to a set of defined equations. The model calculates the state of the outlet flows based on the inlet flows and the unit’s physical properties. These properties are defined by performance parameters, while the simulation includes mass, energy, and momentum balances, along with performance equations.\nIn terms of stream flows, the Gibbs phase rule asserts that only \\(N+2\\) variables are required to characterize a stream’s state, where \\(N\\) is the number of compounds in the flow, and one of these \\(N+2\\) variables must be extensive (typically the mass flow, \\(\\dot{m}_{\\text{WF}}\\)). For this analysis, \\(N\\) is assumed to be one, as all flows consist of pure, monophasic fluids.",

With a Global Warming Potential (GWP) of 3.3, R-290 has a relatively low contribution to climate change compared to many other refrigerants. However, its primary drawback lies in its flammability, which raises safety concerns that must be carefully managed. Despite this limitation, R-290 is widely used in large-scale systems due to its excellent thermodynamic properties and cost-effectiveness (Nawaz et al. 2017).\nFor comparison, the second fluid considered is Tetrafluoropropene (R-1234yf). This fluid offers a low GWP of 4, making it an environmentally sustainable alternative. With an atmospheric lifetime of just 0.03 years and zero ozone depletion potential, R-1234yf minimizes its long-term environmental impact. In terms of safety, R-1234yf belongs to the A2L safety classification: “A” indicates low toxicity, “2” signifies lower flammability, and “L” designates a slow-burning subcategory (UNEP/ASHRAE 2022). These properties make it an appealing option for applications prioritizing environmental compliance and safety. However, higher operating costs are expected using R1234yf compared to other working fluids (Garcı́a-Pabón et al. 2021).",

All reference values provided to the model are derived from observations of physical properties, which carry margins of error. Generally, two types of errors are considered:\n\nSystematic errors: These arise from a consistent offset in measurements, typically stemming from instrument bias or dependencies on identifiable quantities.\nRandom errors: These represent variability in repeated measurements that cannot be predicted from prior readings and are often due to sensor noise or natural fluctuations.\n\nWhile random errors may be minimized with filtering, systematic errors require multiple measurements to estimate and adjust for offsets.\nData reconciliation is necessary to ensure that deviations in systematic measurements do not lead to violations of mass or energy conservation laws. By leveraging redundant measurements in the model, data reconciliation minimizes the difference between observed and expected values, effectively solving a constrained nonlinear optimization problem:\n\\[\n\\min_{X, Y} \\sum_{i=1}^{n_{\\text{mes}}} \\left( \\frac{y_i - y_i^*}{\\sigma_i} \\right)^2\n\\]\nsubject to:\n\nMass Balance \\((X, Y) = 0\\)\nEnergy Balance \\((X, Y) = 0\\)\nThermodynamic \\((X, Y) = 0\\)\nConstitutive Equations \\((X, Y) = 0\\)\nPerformance \\((X, Y, \\pi) = 0\\)\nInequalities \\((X, Y) = 0\\)\n\nwhere:\n\n\\(y_i\\) is a state variable value,\n\\(y_i^*\\) is the measured value,\n\\(\\sigma_i\\) is the standard deviation of the measurement.\n\nIn this problem, \\(X\\) represents the state variables to estimate (i.e., non-measured), and \\(Y\\) represents the measured state variables.

Although a higher-order polynomial might offer improved precision, it could lead to overfitting due to limited data points.\nThis analysis is performed for each working fluid at both low and medium temperature levels.

To evaluate this economic impact, the unit cost of the two-stage heat pump is calculated, accounting for the size of both components.\nThe area of heat exchangers is determined under worst-case conditions, which then defines the compressor size. With reconciled results and ambient temperatures, the size of these units enables cost estimation.\nOn the one hand, the heat exchanger includes both a condenser and an evaporator, allowing us to separate its total cost into two components:\n\\[\nC_{\\text{HEX}} = C_{\\text{condenser}} + C_{\\text{evaporator}}\n\\tag{4.5}\\]\nFor both heat exchangers the cost is evaluated based on the area needed for the heat exchanger. The equation for the cost is the following:\n\nCondensator: Cost = \\(10^{k_1 + k_2 *\\log_{10}(A_{cond}) + k_3*( \\log_{10}(A_{cond}) )^2} \\cdot \\frac{I}{I_{ref}} \\cdot f_{BM}\\)\nEvaporator: Cost = \\(10^{k_1 + k_2 *\\log_{10}(A_{evap}) + k_3*( \\log_{10}(A_{evap}) )^2} \\cdot \\frac{I}{I_{ref}} \\cdot f_{BM}\\)\n\nwhere (Ali 2013):\n\n\\(k_i\\) are empirical constants,\n\\(A\\) is the heat transfer are of the unit,\n\\(I\\) is the cost index.\n\\(I_{ref}\\) is the reference cost index corresponding to the time when the \\(k_i\\) were determined.\n\\(f_{BM}\\) is the bare module factor.\n\nOn the other hand, the system includes two compressors, so the total compressor cost can be expressed as:\n\\[\nC_{\\text{compressor}} = C_{\\text{compressor1}} + C_{\\text{compressor2}}\n\\tag{4.6}\\]\nThe cost for the compressors is given by the formula:\nCost = \\(10^{k_1 + k_2 *\\log_{10}(W_{max}) + k_3*( \\log_{10}(W_{max}) )^2} \\cdot \\frac{I}{I_{ref}} \\cdot f_{BM}\\)\nwhere \\(W_{max}\\) is the power needed by the compressor during the extreme period.\nThe total cost of the heat pump system is then defined as:\n\\[\nC_{\\text{HP}} = C_{\\text{HEX}} + C_{\\text{compressor}}\n\\tag{4.7}\\]\nFinally, the unit cost of the system can be determined based on the installed heat pump capacity:\n\\[\nc_{\\text{HP}} = \\frac{C_{\\text{HP}}}{Q_{\\text{HP}}} \\quad [\\text{CHF/kW}]\n\\tag{4.8}\\]\nTable 4.3 lists the worst-case conditions that determine the system’s total cost.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.3: Cost Estimation for the Heat Pump System\n\n\n\n\nCost Estimation for the Heat Pump System\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameters\nR-290 LT\nR-290 MT\nR-1234yf LT\nR-1234yf MT\n\n\n\n\nCondenser Area [m2]\n636\n1432\n1374\n1621\n\n\nEvaporator Area [m2]\n1306\n1359\n1015\n703\n\n\nCost HEX [CHF]\n1799373\n2618830\n2205921\n2194472\n\n\nCost Compressor 1 [CHF]\n572195\n619408\n637552\n795136\n\n\nCost Compressor 2 [CHF]\n692000\n771960\n1058090\n1480810\n\n\nCompressors Cost [CHF]\n1264195\n1393368\n1695642\n22759467\n\n\nTotal Heat Pump Cost [CHF]\n2864568\n4000198\n3890563\n4470418\n\n\nUnit Cost per kW [CHF/kW]\n520\n664\n760\n715",

Economically, R-290 also proves to be the more cost-effective solution under worst-case conditions, providing substantial savings in operating costs.\nHowever, it is essential to consider the environmental and safety trade-offs. R-1234yf has an exceptionally short atmospheric lifetime of 0.03 years compared to R-290, which lingers for approximately 12 years—making the former nearly 400 times less persistent in the atmosphere. Additionally, R-1234yf is classified as a low-flammability refrigerant (A2L), offering a safer alternative, whereas R-290 poses higher flammability risks that must be addressed. However, R-290 offers the lowest GWP of the two working fluids.\nGiven this analysis, R-290 is recommended for EPFL’s new two-stage heat pump. While it presents some challenges in terms of flammability and atmospheric persistence, its superior thermodynamic and economic performance makes it a highly viable option. With robust safety measures in place to mitigate potential hazards, R-290 can reliably and efficiently support the campus’s heating needs while aligning with cost-saving objectives.\n\n\n\n\nAli, Chaudhry Hassan. 2013. “Capital Cost Estimation Chapter 5.” 2013. https://fr.slideshare.net/slideshow/chapter-5-17550956/17550956.\n\n\nGarcı́a-Pabón, Juan J, Dario Méndez-Méndez, Juan M Belman-Flores, Juan M Barroso-Maldonado, and Ali Khosravi. 2021. “A Review of Recent Research on the Use of R1234yf as an Environmentally Friendly Fluid in the Organic Rankine Cycle.” Sustainability 13 (11): 5864.\n\n\nMorisaki, Takafumi, Junichi Ohara, Takeshi Yasunaga, and Yasuyuki Ikegami. 2024. “Performance Analysis of Double-Stage Heat Pump and Refrigeration Cycles.” Applied Thermal Engineering, 123732.\n\n\nNawaz, Kashif, Bo Shen, Ahmed Elatar, Van Baxter, and Omar Abdelaziz. 2017. “R290 (Propane) and R600a (Isobutane) as Natural Refrigerants for Residential Heat Pump Water Heaters.” Applied Thermal Engineering 127: 870–83.\n\n\nUNEP/ASHRAE. 2022. “Update on New Refrigerants Designations and Safety Classifications.” 2022. https://www.ashrae.org/file%20library/technical%20resources/bookstore/factsheet_ashrae_english_november2022.pdf.",

    "text": "5.2 Energy conversion technologies\nThe following introduced energy conversion technologies will be considered for the new heating system of EPFL. The utilities will be briefly described and then their implimentation in the AMPL model will be presented.\n\n5.2.1 Cogeneration\nA cogeneration enigne, aslo known as combined heat and power (CHP), uses one fuel source to produce heat and power. By producing both heat and power, the CHP saves greenhouse emissions compared to a seperate unit. For this model, natural gas is considered as the fuel of this unit. In a gas turbine,the natural gas is mixed with air, compressed and then ignited. A generator produces electricity and through a heat recovery steam generator the hot water loop of the EPFL is also heated.\nThis unit will be sized such that the electricity demand of the campus at a given time is fulfilled.\nHere are the assumptions for the modeling of the utility:\n\nlifetime is assumed to be 20 years\nThermal efficiency \\(\\eta_{thermal} = 0.45\\) and electrical efficiency \\(\\eta_{elec} = 0.45\\), such that the unit has a total efficiency of \\(\\eta_{chp} = \\eta_{thermal} + \\eta_{elec} = 0.8\\) (Ken Darrow and Hampson (2017))\n\nFrom Professors Maréchal’s lecture in Advanced Energetics about Utility integration, the costs for the sizing are given. For an installed capacity between 100 - 10 000 kW, the CAPEX ranges from 800 - 4000 CHF/kW. From this the fixed part (cinv1) and variable part (cinv2) of the investment has been extracted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Investment cost vs installed capacity for cogeneration unit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Fuel cells\nSolid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) are electrochemical devices that convert the chemical energy of fuel into electrical energy. They normally operate in the range of 500-800°C. Heat can be recovered from the high temperature exhaust gas of SOFC, thereby increasing the energy efficiency of process (Roy et al. 2024).\nFuel cells hold the promise of power generation with higher efficiency and lower pollution. They offer superior performance compared to heat engines, partly due to the fact that these devices can bypass the limitations imposed by carnot efficiecny (Roy et al. 2024). The higher efficiency of these devices also mean that the greenhouse gas emission can be significantly reduced (Pina et al. 2023). Another advantage of fuel cells is the fuel flexibility. They can be operated with a wide variety of fuels such as natural gas, ammonia, hydrogen, biogas etc (Pina et al. 2023; Roy et al. 2024).\nThe system is usually made up of SOFC stack and Balance of Plant components (BoP). The BoP include blowers or compressors for air and fuel, combustor to completely burn the fuel and heat exchangers to recover heat from the exhaust gases. Pina et al. (2023), compared the performance of SOFC utilizing five different fuels (methane, methanol, diesel, ammonia and hydrogen) for cruise ships. They showed that by cathode off-gas recirculation (COGR), the investment costs for the SOFC unit are reduced. Further with COGR, the amount of air required for each fuel type reduced, which resulted in higher quality exhaust gas at combustor outlet.\nFor the modeling of fuel cells, a black box model is used. The fuel cell is modeled as single 100 kW unit, and it is assumed that these 100 kW units will be stacked together to provide the energy demand of the campus. Hydrogen is the fuel selected to operate the fuel cells despite it being the most expensive fuel in Pina’s studies. The decision to study hydrogen is based on its low environmental impact (depending on the source of hydrogen it can be completely carbon neutral). The following efficiencies are used to model the fuel cell (Pina et al. 2023):\n\nElectrical efficiency \\(\\eta_{\\mathrm{elec}}\\) = 0.4676. In their paper, Pina defined the efficiency to be 0.49. However, because here the fuel cell is modeled as black box and we are only interested in finding how much net electrical power could be obtained this value was reduced to account for electrical energy needed for BoP components.\nThermal efficiency \\(\\eta_{\\mathrm{thermal}}\\) = 0.4117. The thermal efficiency is based on how much heat was recoverd in Pina’s paper to how much fuel flow into the system.\n\nBased on the data from Pina (Pina et al. 2023), the following costs are estimated for a single 100 kW module:\n\nFixed investment costs : \\(\\mathrm{c_{inv1}}\\) = 0 CHF/year\nVariable investment costs : \\(\\mathrm{c_{inv2}}\\) = 101,886 CHF/year\n\nThe variable costs also include the costs for stack replacement assuming stack lifetime of 5 year. The model estimates the number of stacks required to meet the energy demand of campus.\n\n\n5.2.3 PV panels\nPhotovoltaic (PV) systems provide a renewable energy source by converting solar radiation into electricity using silicon-based solar cells. With typical efficiencies around \\(\\eta = 0.18\\), these systems are scalable from small residential setups to large utility-scale installations.\nKey characteristics include:\n\nAnnual Degradation: Approximately 0.5% (\\(\\mathrm{degradation} = 0.005\\)), affecting long-term performance.\nArea Requirement: About 7 m\\(^2\\) per kilowatt of capacity.\nCapacity Factor: Generally around 0.15 in moderate solar resource locations.\nLifespan: PV panels typically have a lifespan of 25 years or more.\n\nInvestment Costs: -\n\nFixed investment cost: \\(c_{\\text{inv1}} = 143.28 \\text{ CHF}\\)\nVariable investment cost: \\(c_{\\text{inv2}} = 457.59 \\text{ CHF/kW}\\)\n\nOperational and maintenance costs are relatively low, estimated at about \\(10 \\text{ CHF/kW/year}\\).\nFrom an environmental perspective, PV systems produce no direct emissions during operation, with lifecycle emissions from manufacturing estimated at \\(40 \\text{ kg CO}_2\\text{eq/kW}\\). This positions PV as a key technology for reducing carbon footprints in energy systems.\n\n\n5.2.4 Boiler\nA boiler uses natural gas as a heat source for heating water or other fluids. The heated fluid can then be used either as a heat source, as for instance in water bearing systems or in other applications.\nThe heat provided by the fuel needed to obtain the wanted heat supply is calculated as following:\n\\(\\mathrm{Q{fuel} [W]= Q_{heating supply}/ \\eta_{boiler}}\\), where \\(\\eta_{boiler}\\) is given as 0.9 (Stadler et al. 2018).\nThe cost of installing a boiler is given by a fixed cost and an installation cost:\n\\(\\mathrm{CAPEX_{boiler}[CHF]= c_{fixed} + c_{variable}*S}\\) given in [CHF]\nwhere\n\n\\(\\mathrm{S}\\) - installed capcity of the boiler given in [kW]\n\\(\\mathrm{c_{fixed}}\\)= 79750 CHF\n\\(\\mathrm{c_{variable}}\\)= 288.62 CHF/kW\n\n\n\n5.2.5 Electric boiler\nElectric boilers offer a promising alternative to traditional natural gas boilers in energy systems. By using electricity to heat water via electrode systems, electric boilers provide controlled output from 0 to 100% of their nominal capacity, making them highly flexible for auxiliary services or leveraging spot market electricity prices (Agency 2019).\nThese devices, typically in the megawatt size range, are suitable for district heating systems, producing hot water or steam. Like natural gas boilers, electric boilers are often used as peak load units, but they do not rely on fossil fuels. This electrification could contributes significantly to reducing carbon emissions in scenarios targeting minimal environmental impact.\nElectric boilers also demonstrate a high conversion efficiency from electrical to thermal energy, with efficiencies reaching \\(\\eta = 0.99\\) (Soysal et al. 2016). This efficiency allows a lower minimum temperature set point of \\(T_{\\text{min}} = 70^\\circ\\text{C}\\) (Jiang et al. 2013). However, from an exergy perspective, their efficiency is moderate, emphasizing the importance of context in evaluating their effectiveness.\nAlthough uncertainty remains in the potential installed capacity, electrode boilers connected to medium- or high-voltage grids (at 10 kV) can achieve production capacities of several megawatts. For this project, an installed capacity of at least 10 MW is assumed, with a lifetime of 20 years (Agency 2019).\nInvestment costs are influenced by electricity prices and installation specifics. Based on average installation costs (Graham 2022) and nominal investments (Soysal et al. 2016), the following costs are estimated:\n\nFixed investment cost: \\(c_{\\text{inv1}} = 435.92 \\, \\text{CHF/year}\\)\nVariable investment cost: \\(c_{\\text{inv2}} = 75,000 \\, \\text{CHF/year}\\)\n\nThese estimates provide a baseline for integrating electric boilers into energy optimization models, considering both economic and environmental impacts.",

TOTEX is defined by eq 5.1:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{\\min TOTEX = w_{CAPEX} \\cdot CAPEX + w_{OPEX} \\cdot OPEX + w_{ENVEX} \\cdot ENVEX \\ [\\frac{CHF}{year}]}\n\\tag{5.1}\\]\n\n\n5.4.2 Model equations\nThe equations used to set up the MILP model are defined below. For the description of variables used in the following equations, see Table 5.1 and Table 5.2.\n\nBuilding heating demand - The heating demand of each building is calculated using eq 5.2 \\[\n\\mathrm{\\dot{Q}_{b,t}^{heating} = A^{th}_{b} (U_{b}^{env}(T_{int} - T_{ext_t}) +  m_{air}C_{p,air}(T_{int} - T_{ext,new_{t}}) - k_b^{sun}\\cdot I_t - \\dot{Q}_b^{people} - f_{el}\\dot{E}_b)}\n\\tag{5.2}\\]\n\nThe total heating demand for each level in each time period given by eq 5.3, eq 5.4: \\[\n\\mathrm{\\dot{Q}mt_t^- = \\sum_b^{MB} \\dot{Q}_{b,t}^{heating}}\n\\tag{5.3}\\]\n\\[\n\\mathrm{\\dot{Q}lt_t^- = \\sum_b^{MB} \\dot{Q}_{b,t}^{heating}}\n\\tag{5.4}\\]\n\nVentilation heat recovery - The amount of heat recovered from ventilation air is given by eq 5.5: \\[\n\\mathrm{Q_{vent} = \\sum_b^B m_{air,out}C_{p_{air}}\\cdot(T_{int}-T_{release_t})\\cdot A_b^{th}}\n\\tag{5.5}\\]\n\nThe heat exchanger area required for ventilation heat recovery is given by eq 5.6.

Eq 5.10 ensures that the usage of a utility does not exceed the installation size. \\[\n\\mathrm{f_u^{min} \\cdot y_u \\leq f_u \\leq f_u^{max} \\cdot y_u}\n\\tag{5.8}\\]\n\n\\[\n\\mathrm{f_{u,t}^{min} \\cdot y_{u,t} \\leq f_{u,t} \\leq f_{u,t}^{max} \\cdot y_{u,t}}\n\\tag{5.9}\\]\n\\[\n\\mathrm{f_{u,t} \\leq f_u}\n\\tag{5.10}\\]\nTo ensure that the ventilation heat exchanger and heat pump are used for all time periods, in the AMPL model the above constraints are added with conditional statements and are valid as long as the utility under consideration is not heat pump or heat exchanger.

In the base case the weights associated with each cost element is set to 1 in eq 5.1. Figure 5.4 shows the heating demand for buildings for each typical period. As expected, the maximum heat demand is during the extreme period and it becomes lower when the temperature and irradiation is higher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: Heating demand per period\n\n\n\n\nThe optimal cost for meeting the heating demand of EPFL campus with the installation of new technologies is 2 261 368 \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{CHF}}{\\mathrm{year}}\\). The breakdown of TOTEX is:\n\nInvestment cost = 671 508 \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{CHF}}{\\mathrm{year}}\\).\nOperational cost = 1 585 234 \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{CHF}}{\\mathrm{year}}\\).\nEnvironment cost = 4 626 \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{CHF}}{\\mathrm{year}}\\).\n\nTable 5.5 lists the technologies considered for energy system along with their installed capacity and annualized costs. Figure 5.5 shows the usage of each technology for each typical period.\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.5: Technologies selected by optimizer, their installed capacity and associated costs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.5: Contribution of different technologies to energy demand of campus for each typical period\n\n\n\n\nA few remarks about the optimal solution are listed below:\n\nIt is interesting to note that the PV panels are not included in the optimum solution. Possible reasoning for the exclusion of PV panels is the high investment costs associated with them.\nSolid oxide fuel cell is also not part of the optimal solution. This was expected as the initial investment associated with fuel cells is very high. Also, in the model the fuel cells are operated on hydrogen, which compared to natural gas is quite expensive.\nFor cogeneration, maximum capacity has been selected by optimizer. This has to do with the fact that cogeneration is very effective technology and can provide both electrical and thermal energy. Looking at Figure 5.5 we can see that cogeneration is used in all periods. For periods with low heating demand i.e. period 1 and 3 it is preferred over boiler, as it can provide electrical energy as well.\nThe installed capacity of electrical boiler is the largest of all technologies considered. However, the EB are only for the extreme period (period 4), where the installed capacity of boiler and cogeneration unit is insufficient to meet the campus demands. Perhaps, if the maximum capacity of cogeneration and boiler units were higher, electric boiler will not even be part of optimal solution.",

    "text": "5.5 Scenario analysis\nA scenario analysis explores and evaluates the influence of possible future events and its implications on todays descisions. In this report, three potential futures will be examined using scenario analysis. For each scenario, the objective function within the MILP optimization model will be adjusted to appropriately reflect the varying priorities and outcomes.\n\n5.5.1 Scenario 1: Minimize operating costs\nIn this scenario, EPFL currently operates with a significant budget, allowing for substantial capital investments. However, projections suggest that this economic flexibility will be significantly reduced in the coming years due to a financial crisis. This anticipated shift necessitates a strategic approach to planning the future heating system of EPFL, with an emphasis on ensuring long-term operating costs are sufficiently low to support the institution’s economic sustainability.\nTo reflect this scenario in the MILP model, the objective function is adjusted so that it minimizes the operating costs. This approach acknowledges that while short-term spending flexibility exists, it must be utilized to mitigate the impacts of future budgetary restrictions. Table 5.6 shows the technologies and their installed capacities. A boiler, a cogeneration engine and PV panels will be installed with the mentioned capacities. In this scenario, most of the heat capacity will come from the boiler, due to the fact that the unit cost of natural gas is quite low compared to other resources.\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.6: Technologies selected by optimizer, their installed capacity and associated costs when the objective is to minimize OPEX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey performance indicators when trying to minimise the OPEX, are shown in Table 5.7. Compared to results discussed in Section 5.4.3 ,both the CAPEX and ENVEX are higher, as the objective mainly prioritises minimization of operating costs.\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.7: Key performance indicators when the objective is to minimize OPEX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.5.2 Scenario 2: Rising natural gas prices and climate protests\nThe second scenario examines a future where the price of natural gas has significantly increased, making it a less economically viable heating source for EPFL. In addition, climate activists strongly advocate for a transition away from natural gas due to its environmental impact, urging institutions like EPFL to adopt more sustainable energy solutions. In response to these pressures, EPFL aims to minimize its reliance on natural gas, aligning with both economic and environmental goals.\nTo reflect this scenario in the model, the objective function is adjusted to minimize the use of natural gas. This change not only addresses the financial implications of rising energy costs but also supports EPFL’s commitment to reducing its carbon footprint. By prioritizing alternative energy sources and optimizing the heating system, the model will identify strategies to limit natural gas consumption while maintaining operational efficiency.\nThe objective function used for this optimisation is to minimize ENVEX, which is the cost related to the environmental impact of a utility. Here PV, cogeneration, SOFC and an electric boiler will be installed as indicated by Table 5.8. Most of the heat will be provided from the electric boiler.\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.8: Technologies selected by optimizer, their installed capacity and associated costs when the objective is to minimize ENVEX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.9 shows the key performance indicators when the objective is to minimize environmental impact. Both the CAPEX and the OPEX are significantly larger in this case compared to scenario 1 and the ENVEX is about 1/5. This is reasonable since the objective function in this case does not prioritise the minimisation of the operational and investment costs.\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.9: Key performance indicators when the objective is to minimize ENVEX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.5.3 Scenario 3: Capital investment restrictions\nIn the third scenario, EPFL faces severe financial limitations, making it difficult to allocate funds for large capital investments. As a result, the institution’s immediate focus shifts to minimizing the costs of installing new technologies, particularly those related to energy systems.\nTo model this scenario in the AMPL model, the objective function is adjusted to minimize the capital expenditure associated with the installation of new technologies. This approach considers only affordable, lower-cost technologies that can be implemented with the available budget, while still delivering the required performance levels. When the CAPEX is minimized the optimal combination of utilities is a boiler, a cogeneration engine and a electrical boiler as shown in Table 5.10. Compared to the case of minimization of OPEX, here the optimal solution excludes the use of PV panels, due to the high investment costs associated with PV panels\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.10: Technologies selected by optimizer, their installed capacity and associated costs when the objective is to minimize CAPEX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe impact of this new objective function is clearly visible in Table 5.11. By minimising the CAPEX, the OPEX gets quite large. Due to the current financial situation of this scenario, having larger budgets the following years is not necessarily realistic and the large operational costs may present a probelm.\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.11: Key performance indicators when the objective is to minimize CAPEX",

    "text": "5.7 Sensitivity Analysis\nThis section presents the results of the sensitivity analysis performed to evaluate the impact of electricity price variations on the total cost of the energy system. Electricity prices were incrementally increased from the baseline value of 0.0916 CHF/kWh up to 0.2416 CHF/kWh in five steps. The total cost, which includes both investment and operational expenses, was calculated for each price level to assess how sensitive the system’s performance is to changes in electricity prices.\nThe analysis reveals an interesting trend, as shown in Figure 5.7. At the baseline electricity price of 0.0916 CHF/kWh, the total cost of the system is 21.866 MCHF. However, as the price increases slightly to 0.1016 CHF/kWh, the total cost unexpectedly drops to 21.861 MCHF, reflecting an optimization shift in the system. This reduction suggests that the model adjusts its operational strategy —potentially by reducing reliance on grid electricity and utilizing more cost-effective technologies— to offset the increased electricity price.\nBeyond this point, the relationship between electricity price and total cost follows a clear upward trend. For instance, when the price is set to 0.1216 CHF/kWh, the total cost rises to 21.872 MCHF. This trend continues and the total cost peaks at 21.942 MCHF when the electricity price reaches the end of our range i.e. 0.2416 CHF/kWh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.7: Impact of electricity prices on annual total cost\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results highlight two key observations:\n\nInitial Cost Reduction: The initial drop in total cost as electricity price increases suggests a system optimization to mitigate the effect of price changes. This could involve reduced grid electricity usage, increased utilization of alternative technologies, or a shift in operational parameters.\nGradual Cost Increase: Beyond the initial optimization, the total cost rises progressively with electricity price increments. This trend indicates that the capacity of the system to adapt its configuration diminishes as electricity prices continue to climb.",

    "section": "5.8 Summary of MILP optimization",
    "text": "5.8 Summary of MILP optimization\nTo meet the future energy demands of the EPFL campus, various energy conversion technologies were reviewed, considering their environmental impact and sustainability. Technologies examined include boilers, cogeneration, electric boilers, fuel cells, and solar panels. These technologies were linearized in terms of cost and performance and integrated into a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model. Results from the heat recovery section (Chapter 3) were also included.\nThe MILP model determined the optimal combination of technologies to minimize total yearly costs (TOTEX). Different scenarios were analyzed, prioritizing either operational costs (OPEX),capital cost (CAPEX) or environmental impact (ENVEX). Table 5.13 illustrates how these objectives affect different key performance indicators (KPIs). The KPIs are similar when minimizing TOTEX, OPEX, or capital costs (CAPEX). However, minimizing environmental impact reduces CO\\(_2\\) emissions but significantly increases total costs due to the installation and use of advanced technologies like fuel cells.\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.13: Summary of key performance indicator for the MILP model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.14 summarizes the impact of changing objective on the selection of energy technologies and their installed capacities. It can be seen that cogeneration is always a part of optimal solution with different installed capacity, regardless of objective function. This is because cogeneration units are highly efficient and provide energy at the expense of low emissions and low cost. On the other end, SOFC are only preferred when the objective is to minimize the environmental impact, as was expected due to high investment as well as operational costs of fuel cells running on H\\(_2\\). Electric boilers are also favored in most cases except when the objective is to minimize the cost, due to relatively higher cost of electricity compared to natural gas.\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.14: Summary of optimum energy technologies and their installed capacities for different scenarios\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor multi-objective optimization, a Pareto-front is used to compare the trade off between environmental costs and capital investment. Minimizing capital costs favored traditional technologies like boilers and cogeneration powered by natural gas. Conversely, minimizing environmental impact required significant investment in advanced technologies such as fuel cells and PV panels, which currently incur high costs. The analysis highlighted distinct optimal solutions: cost-efficient yet carbon-intensive options, and greener but more expensive alternatives, emphasizing the trade-offs in sustainable energy system design. The effect of electricity price on TOTEX is evaluated by sensitivity study. In general, with increasing electrical prices the annual total cost increased, but because of flexibility of system due to multiple technologies, the change in TOTEX is not too drastic.\n\n\n\n\nAgency, Danish Energy. 2019. “Technology Data: Generation of Electricity and District Heating.” Retrieved August 27th, 2019.\n\n\nGraham, Adam. 2022. “How Much Does It Cost to Install an Electric Boiler?” https://www.fixr.com/costs/electric-fired-boiler-system.\n\n\nInternational Energy Agency (IEA). 2024.

    "text": "From all the analysis conducted in the span of this project the following recommondations can be made for the heat supply of the EPFL campus.\nIn general it is recommendable to renovate the existing buildings of the campus to reduce the energy consumption of the EPFL campus. It is therefore recommended to lower the thermal transmittance \\(k_{th}\\) through additional or improved insulation, upgrade windows, and minimizing thermal bridges. Increasing \\(k_{sun}\\), by optimizing window placement and improving solar transmittance, enhances passive solar gains and reduces heating demand. For most of the buildings the window placement is fixed, so solar transmittance will be the main way to improve \\(k_{sun}\\). It is recommended to be careful in trying to increase \\(k_{sun}\\) too much due to the danger of overheating during summer. Additionally, adjusting the indoor temperature within an optimal range for occupant comfort and performance (21–22°C) can provide a balance between energy efficiency and functional work environments. Lower indoor temperatures, when feasible, offer substantial energy savings.\nThe clustering method using the k-means algorithm with \\(k = 3\\), was used when analysing the different heat recovery possibilities for the campus. Among the evaluated scenarios, air ventilation with heat pump integration emerged as the preferred solution. Although it has slightly higher total expenditures, compared to the case of heat recovery from ventilation air, the heat pump integration leads to higher energy savings and consequently lower \\(\\mathrm{CO}_2\\) emissions. Additionally, the long-term benefits of reduced carbon footprint and enhanced energy efficiency make this technology a more sustainable and environmentally friendly choice.\nFor different scenarios the optimal combination of utilities has been given by the MILP optimisatioin model. Based on EPFL’s budget and future incomes, the most realistic scenario must be chosen. If the budget for the coming year is restricted, the scenario where the OPEX is minimized is the most realistic. In this case, most of the heat will be provided by a boiler. If EPFL choses that the climate is the most important aspect, then an electric boiler and other technologies like SOFC and PV panels will be utilisied. The solution for this scenario is very expensive and an investment of such an order is highly unrealistic. Other ways for improving the environmetal footprint like Carbon capturing should therefore be considered. Finally, if EPFL has a restricted budget for investing in new technologies then lower-cost technologies like a boiler or a cogeneration engine and an electrical boiler will be implemented.\nThe key recommendations are the following:\n- Renovate the existing buildings\n- Install heat recovery for air ventilation with heat pump integration\n- Use R-290 as a working fluid for the two-stage heat pump\n- Install the technologies based on the preferred scenario",
